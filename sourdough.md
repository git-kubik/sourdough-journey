# Complete One-Day Sourdough Bread Guide (700g Loaf)

## Ingredient List (Precise Measurements)

### For the Bread:
- **Bread flour**: 400g
- **Whole wheat flour**: 100g (or substitute with more bread flour)
- **Water**: 375g (75% hydration)
- **Active sourdough starter**: 100g (at peak activity)
- **Sea salt**: 10g

### Starter Preparation (Night Before):
- **Starter**: 20g from your mother starter
- **Flour**: 40g
- **Water**: 40g

## Overview & Key Principles

This is a same-day bake using an active, well-maintained starter. The key to success lies in timing, temperature control, and reading your dough's development rather than strictly following the clock.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Starter must be at peak activity (doubled, bubbly, passes float test)
- Maintain dough temperature around 24-26°C throughout bulk fermentation
- Develop strong gluten through proper mixing and folding
- Shape with confidence for good surface tension

## Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Starter Preparation (Night Before)
**Time: 8:00 PM (12 hours before mixing)**

Feed your starter with a 1:2:2 ratio (starter:flour:water). Use 20g starter + 40g flour + 40g water. This should give you 100g of active starter by morning. Keep at room temperature (21-24°C).

**Visual Cue**: Starter should double in size and have a pleasant, tangy aroma with visible bubbles throughout.

### Step 2: Autolyse (Morning)
**Time: 8:00 AM**

1. **Mix flours and water only**: Combine 400g bread flour, 100g whole wheat flour, and 375g water in a large mixing bowl
2. **Mix until no dry flour remains**: Use a bowl scraper or your hands - don't overmix
3. **Cover and rest**: 30-60 minutes at room temperature
4. **Check starter**: Should be bubbly and pass the float test (small piece floats in water)

### Step 3: Initial Mix
**Time: 9:00 AM**

1. **Add starter**: Distribute 100g active starter over the autolyse dough
2. **Mix thoroughly**: Use wet hands to fully incorporate starter (2-3 minutes)
3. **Rest 30 minutes**: Cover and let enzymes work

### Step 4: Add Salt & Final Mix
**Time: 9:30 AM**

1. **Dissolve salt**: Mix 10g salt with 15ml warm water
2. **Add to dough**: Pour over dough and mix with wet hands until fully incorporated
3. **Develop initial strength**: Mix vigorously for 2-3 minutes until dough feels smoother

### Step 5: Bulk Fermentation with Folds
**Time: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (4 hours total)**

Perform coil folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, then let dough rest undisturbed.

**Coil Fold Technique:**
- Wet your hands
- Grab dough from one side, lift until it stretches, fold over to opposite side
- Rotate bowl 90° and repeat for all four sides
- Each session takes 30 seconds

**Fold Schedule:**
- 10:00 AM: First fold
- 10:30 AM: Second fold  
- 11:00 AM: Third fold
- 11:30 AM: Fourth fold
- 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Rest undisturbed

**Bulk Fermentation Complete When:**
- Dough has increased 50-70% in size
- Feels light and airy
- Gentle poke springs back slowly
- Visible bubbles on surface

### Step 6: Pre-Shape
**Time: 2:00 PM**

1. **Turn out dough**: Onto lightly floured surface
2. **Pre-shape**: Form into loose round using bench scraper
3. **Rest**: 20-30 minutes, covered with damp towel

### Step 7: Final Shape
**Time: 2:30 PM**

1. **Shape into boule or batard**: Create good surface tension
2. **Seam side up**: Place in banneton or bowl lined with floured towel
3. **Final proof**: 2-3 hours at room temperature OR overnight in refrigerator

**Banneton Alternative**: Use a bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel dusted heavily with rice flour or 50/50 bread flour and rice flour.

### Step 8: Prepare for Baking
**Time: 5:00 PM (30 minutes before baking)**

1. **Preheat Dutch oven**: 260°C with lid on for 30 minutes
2. **Prepare parchment**: Cut square larger than your loaf
3. **Test proofing**: Gentle poke should spring back slowly but leave slight indent

### Step 9: Score & Bake
**Time: 5:30 PM**

1. **Turn out dough**: Onto parchment paper
2. **Score decisively**: One deep slash or pattern with sharp blade
3. **Transfer to pot**: Carefully lower parchment into hot Dutch oven
4. **Bake covered**: 20 minutes at 260°C
5. **Remove lid**: Reduce to 230°C
6. **Bake uncovered**: 20-25 minutes until deep golden brown
7. **Internal temperature**: Should reach 96-99°C

### Step 10: Cool
**Time: 6:15 PM**

Cool on wire rack for **at least 2 hours** before slicing. This is crucial for crumb structure.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Starter Not Active Enough:**
- Wait longer or give another feeding
- Check temperature - too cold slows activity

**Dough Too Sticky:**
- Use wet hands instead of flour
- More coil folds will build structure

**Over-Proofed Dough:**
- Gentle handling during shaping
- May result in less oven spring but still edible

**Under-Proofed Dough:**
- Dense crumb, poor rise
- Next time, extend final proof

**Scoring Issues:**
- Use sharp blade or razor
- Score confidently in one motion
- Dough should be cool, not warm

## Success Indicators

**Good Starter**: Doubles in 4-8 hours, passes float test, pleasant aroma
**Proper Bulk**: 50-70% size increase, jiggly texture, visible bubbles
**Ready to Bake**: Gentle poke springs back slowly with slight indent
**Finished Bread**: Hollow sound when tapped, internal temp 96-99°C
**Perfect Crumb**: Open, irregular holes with thin, shiny crust

## Baker's Notes

- **Temperature matters**: Warmer = faster fermentation
- **Hydration**: This 75% recipe is forgiving for beginners
- **Flour choice**: Bread flour gives better structure than all-purpose
- **Practice**: Each bake teaches you more about reading the dough
- **Patience**: Don't skip the cooling time - it completes the baking process
