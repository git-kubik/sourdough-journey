# Sourdough Troubleshooting Guide

Even experienced bakers encounter challenges. This comprehensive guide addresses the most common sourdough issues with detailed solutions.

## Starter Problems

### Starter Won't Rise
**Symptoms:**
- No volume increase after feeding
- Few or no bubbles
- Smells flat or floury

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Temperature too low**
   - Move to warmer spot (24-27°C/75-80°F)
   - Use warm water for feeding
   - Create proofing box with light bulb

2. **Weak or old flour**
   - Switch to fresh bread flour
   - Try organic flour (more wild yeast)
   - Add 10% whole grain flour

3. **Chlorinated water**
   - Use filtered or bottled water
   - Let tap water sit 24 hours
   
4. **Overfeeding**
   - Reduce feeding ratio
   - Wait longer between feeds
   - Let starter get truly hungry

### Starter Too Acidic
**Symptoms:**
- Strong vinegar smell
- Rises and falls very quickly
- Hooch forms within hours

**Solutions:**
- Feed twice daily at 1:5:5 ratio
- Keep at cooler temperature (21°C/70°F)
- Use less whole grain flour
- Stir down hooch before feeding

## Dough Issues

### Dough Too Sticky
**Symptoms:**
- Sticks to hands and counter
- Won't hold shape
- Difficult to handle

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **High hydration**
   - Reduce water by 5-10%
   - Build up to high hydration gradually
   - Use bread flour (higher protein)

2. **Under-developed gluten**
   - Extend autolyse to 1 hour
   - Add more folds during bulk
   - Use slap and fold technique

3. **Wrong flour type**
   - Ensure 12%+ protein content
   - Avoid all-purpose for high hydration
   - Consider adding vital wheat gluten

**Handling tips:**
- Wet hands frequently
- Use bench scraper
- Work quickly and confidently
- Dust with rice flour

### Dough Won't Hold Shape
**Symptoms:**
- Spreads flat during shaping
- No tension in final shape
- Pancakes in banneton

**Solutions:**
1. **Insufficient gluten development**
   - More folds during bulk fermentation
   - Longer autolyse
   - Check flour protein content

2. **Over-proofed**
   - Reduce bulk fermentation time
   - Lower temperature
   - Shape earlier

3. **Poor shaping technique**
   - Build more tension
   - Use bench rest properly
   - Practice with lower hydration

## Fermentation Problems

### Under-fermented Dough
**Symptoms:**
- Dense, gummy crumb
- Lack of holes
- Heavy feel
- Sour taste lacking

**Solutions:**
- Extend bulk fermentation
- Increase temperature to 26°C (78°F)
- Use more starter (25%)
- Check starter activity
- Do poke test before shaping

### Over-fermented Dough
**Symptoms:**
- Very sticky and slack
- Won't hold shape
- Sour or alcoholic smell
- Flat final loaf

**Solutions:**
- Reduce bulk time
- Lower temperature
- Use less starter
- Shape earlier
- Cold proof immediately

### Inconsistent Fermentation
**Symptoms:**
- Different results each time
- Unpredictable timing
- Variable crumb structure

**Solutions:**
- Monitor dough temperature
- Use same spot for bulk
- Keep detailed notes
- Control room temperature
- Use thermometer

## Shaping Problems

### Can't Build Tension
**Common mistakes:**
- Dough too wet
- Over-proofed
- Poor technique
- Insufficient bench rest

**Solutions:**
1. Light flour dusting
2. Use bench scraper
3. Work quickly
4. Practice with firm dough
5. Watch shaping videos

### Seam Won't Seal
**Solutions:**
- Pinch firmly
- Use less flour on seam
- Wet fingers slightly
- Place seam-side down immediately

## Scoring Issues

### Score Won't Open
**Causes:**
- Blade not sharp enough
- Angle too steep
- Cut too shallow
- Over-proofed dough

**Solutions:**
- Use fresh razor blade
- Hold blade at 30-45° angle
- Cut 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep
- Score confidently and quickly
- Score cold dough

### Irregular Ear Formation
**Solutions:**
- Consistent blade angle
- Smooth, continuous motion
- Proper steam in oven
- Score at slight curve

## Baking Problems

### No Oven Spring
**Symptoms:**
- Flat loaf
- Dense crumb
- Pale crust

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Over-proofed**
   - Reduce final proof time
   - Check with poke test
   - Cold proof for control

2. **Weak gluten**
   - Better shaping technique
   - More folds during bulk
   - Check flour quality

3. **Oven issues**
   - Preheat longer (45+ min)
   - Check oven temperature
   - Ensure proper steam

### Gummy Crumb
**Causes:**
- Under-baked
- Cut too soon
- Under-fermented

**Solutions:**
- Bake to 96-99°C (205-210°F) internal temp
- Cool completely (2+ hours)
- Extend fermentation
- Bake darker crust

### Burnt Bottom
**Solutions:**
- Move rack up
- Add parchment or semolina
- Lower temperature after steam
- Use baking stone under Dutch oven
- Double layer parchment

### Pale Crust
**Causes:**
- Temperature too low
- Insufficient bake time
- Too much steam

**Solutions:**
- Increase temperature
- Bake longer uncovered
- Remove lid after 20 min
- Final 5 min at 245°C (475°F)

## Crumb Issues

### Dense Crumb
**Causes:**
- Under-fermented
- Poor shaping
- Low hydration
- Weak starter

**Solutions:**
- Extend bulk fermentation
- Improve folding technique
- Increase hydration gradually
- Strengthen starter

### Uneven Crumb
**Large holes surrounded by dense areas**

**Causes:**
- Poor shaping
- Uneven folding
- Trapped air

**Solutions:**
- Consistent folding
- Proper degassing
- Even shaping tension
- Pop large bubbles

### Flying Crust (Big gap under top crust)
**Causes:**
- Under-proofed
- Too much flour in shaping
- Poor scoring

**Solutions:**
- Extend final proof
- Use less flour
- Score properly
- Shape tighter

## Quick Diagnostic Guide

### Visual Inspection
1. **Crust color:** Indicates bake level
2. **Shape:** Shows fermentation/shaping
3. **Ear development:** Reveals scoring/proof
4. **Bottom:** Check for even baking

### Crumb Analysis
1. **Hole structure:** Fermentation indicator
2. **Texture:** Hydration and development
3. **Color:** Flour type and bake
4. **Moisture:** Proper baking time

### Taste and Texture
1. **Sourness level:** Fermentation time
2. **Chewiness:** Gluten development
3. **Crust crispness:** Baking technique
4. **Overall flavor:** Process success

## Prevention Strategies

### Keep Detailed Notes
- Temperatures (room, dough, water)
- Timing for each step
- Flour brand and type
- Hydration percentage
- Results and observations

### Maintain Consistency
- Same flour brand
- Consistent temperatures
- Regular feeding schedule
- Same tools and methods
- Controlled environment

### Practice Core Skills
1. **Starter maintenance**
2. **Folding technique**
3. **Shaping skills**
4. **Scoring confidence**
5. **Temperature control**

## Emergency Fixes

### Dough Too Wet to Handle
1. Add 10-20g flour
2. Extra folds with wet hands
3. Use bench scraper liberally
4. Shape on well-floured surface
5. Shorter bench rest

### Forgot to Add Salt
- Dissolve in minimal water
- Add during first fold
- Knead in thoroughly
- Expect faster fermentation

### Over-proofed in Banneton
1. Reshape gently
2. Short bench rest (10 min)
3. Final shape
4. Bake immediately
5. Expect less oven spring

### Stuck in Banneton
1. Freeze for 10 minutes
2. Tap firmly all around
3. Use bench scraper edges
4. Invert confidently
5. Patch tears with wet fingers

Remember: Every "failure" teaches valuable lessons. Document what went wrong and what you tried - this builds your intuition faster than following recipes perfectly!
