# Grains for Sourdough: Part 1 - The Wheat Foundation

## Introduction to the Series

Flour is the foundation of every sourdough loaf, yet many bakers never venture beyond basic bread flour. This four-part series will explore the diverse world of grains available to sourdough bakers, from the familiar wheat varieties to ancient grains and modern alternatives.

Each grain brings its own character to bread: unique flavors, textures, nutritional profiles, and fermentation behaviors. Understanding these differences opens up a world of creative possibilities and helps you choose the right grain for your desired outcome.

In this first installment, we'll explore wheat—the backbone of most sourdough breads—and discover how different wheat varieties can transform your baking.

## Understanding Wheat: The Foundation Grain

Wheat has been humanity's primary bread grain for thousands of years, and for good reason. Its unique protein structure creates gluten, the elastic network that traps gases from fermentation and gives bread its characteristic texture and rise.

But not all wheat is created equal. Different varieties, growing conditions, and processing methods create flours with dramatically different baking properties.

## The Science of Wheat Proteins

Before diving into varieties, it's essential to understand what makes wheat special for bread making:

### Gluten Formation

Wheat contains two main proteins:

- **Gliadin**: Provides extensibility (stretch)
- **Glutenin**: Provides elasticity (bounce-back)

When combined with water and agitated, these proteins link together to form gluten—the elastic network that allows dough to trap gas and rise. Sourdough fermentation actually strengthens this network through enzymatic action and acidification.

### Protein Content Categories

Wheat flours are typically categorized by protein content:

- **Low Protein (8-10%)**: Cake and pastry flours
- **Medium Protein (10-12%)**: All-purpose flours
- **High Protein (12-14%)**: Bread flours
- **Very High Protein (14%+)**: Special bread and pizza flours

For sourdough, protein content affects:

- **Rise potential**: Higher protein generally means better rise
- **Texture**: More protein creates chewier bread
- **Water absorption**: High-protein flours absorb more water
- **Fermentation behavior**: Protein affects how dough handles long fermentation

## Modern Wheat Varieties

### Hard Red Winter Wheat

**Characteristics:**
- Protein content: 10-14%
- Flavor: Robust, slightly nutty
- Color: Darker flour with reddish bran
- Growing region: Great Plains (US), Prairie Provinces (Canada)

**Sourdough Applications:**
- Excellent for everyday sourdough bread
- Handles long fermentation well
- Creates hearty, flavorful loaves
- Good balance of strength and flavor

**Baking Notes:**
Hard red winter wheat is the workhorse of sourdough baking. Its moderate to high protein content provides good structure, while its flavor complements the tang of sourdough perfectly. This wheat responds well to autolyse and benefits from longer fermentation periods.

### Hard Red Spring Wheat

**Characteristics:**
- Protein content: 12-16%
- Flavor: Clean, mild wheat flavor
- Color: Light golden flour
- Growing region: Northern Great Plains, Canada

**Sourdough Applications:**
- Premium bread flour applications
- Excellent for high-hydration doughs
- Creates tall, open-crumb breads
- Ideal for competition-style sourdough

**Baking Notes:**
This is often considered the premium bread wheat. Its high protein content creates strong gluten networks capable of supporting very high hydration levels (80%+). The clean flavor allows sourdough character to shine through without competing grain flavors.

### Hard White Wheat

**Characteristics:**
- Protein content: 10-14%
- Flavor: Mild, sweet, less bitter than red wheat
- Color: Cream-colored flour
- Growing region: Pacific Northwest, some Midwest areas

**Sourdough Applications:**
- Excellent for milder sourdough breads
- Appeals to those new to whole grain baking
- Creates lighter-colored whole wheat breads
- Good for sandwich breads

**Baking Notes:**
Hard white wheat offers an excellent introduction to whole grain sourdough baking. Its milder flavor and lighter color make it more approachable than traditional red wheat, while still providing good protein content for structure.

### Soft Red Winter Wheat

**Characteristics:**
- Protein content: 8-11%
- Flavor: Mild, slightly sweet
- Color: Light flour with fine texture
- Growing region: Eastern United States

**Sourdough Applications:**
- Best blended with higher-protein flours
- Good for tender crumb breads
- Excellent for enriched sourdoughs
- Creates delicate texture when used judiciously

**Baking Notes:**
While lower in protein, soft red winter wheat can add tenderness to sourdough when used as a portion of the flour blend. It's particularly useful in enriched doughs where you want a softer crumb.

## Wheat Processing Levels
