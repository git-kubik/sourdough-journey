# Whole Wheat Country Loaf

*Embracing wheat's full nutritional potential*

This recipe demonstrates how whole wheat flour transforms sourdough with deeper flavors, increased nutrition, and rustic character. Building on principles from [Part 1: The Wheat Foundation](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md), this loaf showcases what happens when we use the entire wheat kernel.

## Why Whole Wheat Changes Everything

From our [wheat processing blog section](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#whole-wheat-flour), **whole wheat brings**:

- **Complete Nutrition**: Bran, germ, and endosperm all included
- **Complex Flavors**: Nutty, earthy notes from bran and germ
- **Faster Fermentation**: Enzymes in bran accelerate activity
- **Higher Hydration Needs**: Bran absorbs significant moisture

## Ingredients (900g loaf)

| Ingredient | Weight | Percentage |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Whole wheat flour | 400g | 80% |
| Bread flour | 100g | 20% |
| Water | 400g | 80% |
| Active starter | 100g | 20% |
| Salt | 10g | 2% |
| Olive oil | 20g | 4% |

**Total dough weight**: ~1,030g  
**Final loaf weight**: ~900g

## Understanding the 80/20 Blend

**Why Not 100% Whole Wheat?**: While possible, the 20% bread flour provides:

- Better rise and structure
- More approachable flavor for beginners
- Easier handling characteristics
- Transition bread before attempting 100% whole wheat

**The 80% whole wheat still delivers**:

- Full nutritional benefits
- Complex, hearty flavors
- Substantial texture
- Traditional country bread character

## Equipment

- Large mixing bowl
- Kitchen scale
- Bench scraper
- Proofing basket or bowl
- Dutch oven
- Lame for scoring
- Wire cooling rack

## Timeline Overview

**Accelerated Timing**: Whole wheat ferments 25-50% faster than white flour due to [enzyme activity in bran](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#fermentation-timing).

### Detailed Schedule

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 8:00 AM | Check starter | Very active needed |
| 8:30 AM | Extended autolyse | 60 minutes for WW |
| 9:30 AM | Mix dough | Add starter, salt, oil |
| 10:00 AM | Bulk fermentation | Watch timing closely |
| 11:00 AM | First fold | Gentle but effective |
| 12:00 PM | Second fold | Dough strengthening |
| 1:00 PM | Third fold | Good development |
| 1:30 PM | Continue bulk | Hands-off period |
| 2:30 PM | Check readiness | Earlier than white |
| 3:00 PM | Pre-shape | Quick rest |
| 3:30 PM | Final shape | Into banneton |
| 6:00 PM | Bake | After 2.5-hour proof |

## Step-by-Step Method

### Step 1: Starter Preparation
Use a very active starter - whole wheat's faster fermentation requires vigorous yeast activity. Consider feeding your starter with 25% whole wheat flour 12 hours before for extra activity.

### Step 2: Extended Autolyse (8:30 AM)
1. Combine 400g whole wheat flour, 100g bread flour, and 400g water
2. Mix until no dry flour remains
3. **Extended 60-minute rest** - crucial for whole wheat
4. Cover tightly to prevent drying

**Why Extended Autolyse?**: As explained in [whole wheat considerations](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#whole-wheat-flour), bran needs extra time to fully hydrate and soften.

### Step 3: Final Dough Mix (9:30 AM)
1. Add 100g active starter to autolyse
2. Mix thoroughly with wet hands
3. Add 10g salt - distribute evenly
4. Drizzle 20g olive oil and incorporate
5. Mix until well combined

**Texture Note**: Dough will feel different from white flour - rougher, more textured, slightly sticky.

### Step 4: Accelerated Bulk Fermentation (10:00 AM - 2:30 PM)

**Faster Timeline**: Watch for visual cues rather than following strict timing.

**Folding Schedule** (every hour for 3 folds):
1. **Wet hands essential** - whole wheat can be sticky
2. **Firm folds** - bran pieces need good distribution
3. **Notice development** - dough strengthens despite bran interference
4. **Cover between folds** - prevents surface drying

**Progression Timeline**:

- **Hour 1**: More active than white flour, increased bubbling
- **Hour 2**: Noticeable strength increase, earthy aromas
- **Hour 3**: Good cohesion despite bran texture
- **Hour 4**: Ready for shaping (faster than white flour)

**Readiness Indicators**:

- 50-70% size increase
- Active bubbling throughout
- Jiggly, alive feel when moved
- Nutty, yeasty aromas
- Poke test: springs back about halfway

### Step 5: Pre-Shape (3:00 PM)
1. Turn onto lightly floured surface
2. Shape into loose round
3. **Bench rest**: 20-30 minutes for gluten relaxation
4. Bran will create slightly rougher surface - this is normal

### Step 6: Final Shaping (3:30 PM)
1. Shape into boule or batard
2. **Surface tension**: Create good tension despite bran
3. Place seam-side up in banneton dusted with rice flour
4. Cover with damp towel

**Shaping with Whole Wheat**: The bran pieces will create a more rustic appearance - embrace this country bread aesthetic.

### Step 7: Final Proof (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM)
**Shorter Proof**: 2.5-3 hours (vs 3+ for white flour)

**Visual Cues**:

- 40-50% size increase
- Slightly domed surface
- Gentle poke springs back slowly
- Earthy, complex aromas

**Temperature Sensitivity**: Whole wheat is more temperature-sensitive - cooler environment extends timing, warmer accelerates.

### Step 8: Scoring and Baking (6:00 PM)

**Scoring Whole Wheat**:

- Score decisively - bran can cause dragging
- Single bold slash or cross pattern works well
- Slightly deeper than white flour scoring

**Baking Process**:
1. **Preheat**: Dutch oven to 500°F for 45 minutes
2. **Steam phase**: 20 minutes covered at 500°F
3. **Browning phase**: 25-30 minutes uncovered at 450°F
4. **Target**: 205-210°F internal temperature
5. **Visual**: Deep golden brown, hollow sound when tapped

### Step 9: Extended Cooling
Cool completely on wire rack (minimum 3 hours). Whole wheat breads continue developing flavor and texture during cooling.

## Flavor Profile

**Expected Characteristics**:

- **Base flavor**: Nutty, earthy, complex
- **Texture**: Denser than white, but tender crumb
- **Crust**: Deeper color, more robust flavor
- **Aroma**: Rich, toasted grain notes

**Flavor Development Tips**:

- **Cold retard**: Refrigerate shaped loaf overnight for deeper flavor
- **Starter boost**: Use whole wheat in starter maintenance
- **Toasted additions**: Light toasting of nuts or seeds complements

## Troubleshooting

### Dense, Heavy Texture
- **Cause**: Over-fermentation or insufficient gluten development
- **Solution**: Watch timing more carefully; ensure adequate folding
- **Reference**: [Whole wheat fermentation timing](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#fermentation-timing)

### Gummy Crumb
- **Cause**: Under-baked or cut too soon
- **Solution**: Bake to full temperature; extend cooling time
- **Reference**: [Troubleshooting whole wheat](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#troubleshooting-common-wheat-flour-issues)

### Poor Rise
- **Cause**: Over-fermentation or weak starter
- **Solution**: Very active starter essential; shorter timing

### Rough, Crumbly Texture
- **Cause**: Insufficient hydration or autolyse
- **Solution**: Ensure full 60-minute autolyse; check hydration

## Nutritional Powerhouse

**Whole Wheat Benefits** (from [nutritional advantages](../../blog/posts/grains-series-part-1.md#whole-wheat-flour)):

- **Fiber**: 3x more than white flour
- **B Vitamins**: Thiamine, riboflavin, niacin
- **Minerals**: Iron, magnesium, zinc
- **Antioxidants**: Naturally occurring in bran
- **Protein**: Higher quality protein profile

**Sourdough Enhancement**: Fermentation increases mineral bioavailability and improves protein digestibility.

## Variations

### **100% Whole Wheat Challenge** (Advanced)
- 500g whole wheat flour only
- Increase water to 425g (85% hydration)
- Even shorter fermentation times
- Pan baking recommended for structure

### **Ancient Grain Addition**
- Replace 100g whole wheat with einkorn or emmer
- Creates unique flavor complexity
- Bridge to [heritage grain recipes](../heritage/sweet-einkorn-loaf.md)

### **Seeded Country Loaf**
- Add 50g mixed seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame)
- 30g chopped walnuts
- Soak seeds 30 minutes before adding during final fold

### **Honey Wheat Version**
- Add 30g honey during mixing
- Reduce water by 10g
- Creates slightly sweet, tender crumb

## Storage and Serving

- **Room Temperature**: 4-5 days wrapped in cloth
- **Freezing**: Excellent for freezing, slice first
- **Serving**: Perfect for robust sandwiches, toast, or with hearty soups
- **Texture**: Improves over 24-48 hours as flavors meld
