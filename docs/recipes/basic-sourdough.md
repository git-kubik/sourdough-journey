# Basic Sourdough Recipe

This is the foundational recipe that forms the basis of most sourdough breads. Master this recipe before moving on to variations.

## Ingredients (700g loaf)

| Ingredient | Weight | Baker's % |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Bread flour | 400g | 80% |
| Whole wheat flour | 50g | 10% |
| Water | 315g | 70% |
| Active starter | 90g | 20% |
| Salt | 9g | 2% |

**Total dough weight:** ~864g (yields ~700g after baking)

## Method Overview

1. **Autolyse** (30-60 min)
2. **Mix** (10 min)
3. **Bulk fermentation** with folds (4-5 hours)
4. **Pre-shape** (20-30 min rest)
5. **Final shape**
6. **Cold proof** (12-48 hours)
7. **Bake** (45 min total)

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Autolyse
Combine flours and water, mix until no dry flour remains. Cover and rest.

### 2. Mix
Add starter and salt, incorporate fully using pinch and fold method.

### 3. Bulk Fermentation
Perform 4 sets of folds every 30 minutes, then rest until 70% increase in volume.

### 4. Shaping
Pre-shape into round, rest, then final shape into boule or batard.

### 5. Cold Proof
Proof seam-side up in banneton in refrigerator overnight.

### 6. Bake
Score and bake in preheated Dutch oven: 20 min covered at 245째C (475째F), then 20-25 min uncovered at 230째C (450째F).

## Recipe Notes

- **Hydration:** 70% is forgiving for beginners
- **Starter ratio:** 20% provides good fermentation power
- **Salt:** 2% of flour weight is standard
- **Flour blend:** 10% whole wheat adds flavor without heaviness

## Scaling the Recipe

To scale for different sizes:

- **500g loaf:** Multiply all ingredients by 0.7
- **1000g loaf:** Multiply all ingredients by 1.4

Always maintain the same ratios for consistent results.

## Variations

Once you master the basic recipe, try:
- Different flour combinations
- Adjusting hydration (65-80%)
- Add-ins like seeds or olives
- Longer fermentation for more flavor
