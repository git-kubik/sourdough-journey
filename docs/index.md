## MaK's Sourdough Philosophy

After maintaining my starter for a month, I've learned that sourdough is as much about patience and observation as it is about technique. This documentation captures both the science and the art of sourdough baking, combining traditional wisdom with modern precision.

> *"Just as in coding, sourdough baking requires patience, iteration, and attention to detail. Each loaf is a deployment, each starter feed is a commit."* — CodeCrust

## Quick Start Guide

If you're ready to bake your first loaf:

1. Ensure your starter passes the float test
2. Follow the [complete one-day guide](getting-started/first-loaf.md)
3. Take notes on your results
4. Refer to [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if needed

## Current Focus

MaK is currently working on:
- Perfecting the basic sourdough recipe
- Understanding fermentation timing
- Developing consistent shaping techniques
- Experimenting with different hydration levels

While CodeCrust continues to optimize the documentation system, deployment pipeline, and technical infrastructure supporting this journey.

## Join the Journey

This site will grow as my skills develop. Each bake teaches something new, and I'll document the lessons learned along the way.
