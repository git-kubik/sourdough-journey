## My Sourdough Philosophy

After maintaining my starter for a month, I've learned that sourdough is as much about patience and observation as it is about technique. This documentation captures both the science and the art of sourdough baking.

## Quick Start Guide

If you're ready to bake your first loaf:

1. Ensure your starter passes the float test
2. Follow the [complete one-day guide](getting-started/first-loaf.md)
3. Take notes on your results
4. Refer to [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if needed

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on:
- Perfecting my basic sourdough recipe
- Understanding fermentation timing
- Developing consistent shaping techniques
- Experimenting with different hydration levels

## Join the Journey

This site will grow as my skills develop. Each bake teaches something new, and I'll document the lessons learned along the way.
