## MaK's Sourdough Philosophy

After maintaining my starter for a month, I've learned that sourdough is as much about patience and observation as it is about technique. This documentation captures both the science and the art of sourdough baking, combining traditional wisdom with modern precision.

> *"Just as in coding, sourdough baking requires patience, iteration, and attention to detail. Each loaf is a deployment, each starter feed is a commit."* — CodeCrust
