# Folding & Shaping Techniques

Proper folding and shaping are crucial for developing gluten structure and creating a beautiful final loaf. These techniques require practice but are essential skills for consistent results.

## Folding During Bulk Fermentation

### Purpose of Folding
- Develops gluten structure
- Redistributes yeast and bacteria
- Incorporates air for better rise
- Strengthens dough for shaping

### Basic Fold Technique

1. **Wet your hands** to prevent sticking
2. **Reach under the dough** from one side
3. **Stretch upward** until you feel resistance
4. **Fold over** to the opposite side
5. **Rotate the bowl** 90 degrees
6. **Repeat** 3 more times (4 folds total)

### Fold Schedule

| Time | Fold # | Dough Feel | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| 30 min | 1 | Loose, extensible | Easy to stretch |
| 1 hour | 2 | Gaining strength | More resistance |
| 1.5 hours | 3 | Smooth, elastic | Holds shape better |
| 2 hours | 4 | Strong structure | Final fold |

### Signs of Proper Development
- Dough feels smooth and supple
- Surface becomes glossy
- Holds its shape between folds
- Springs back when poked gently

## Advanced Folding Techniques

### Coil Folds
Best for very high hydration doughs:
1. Wet hands thoroughly
2. Slide hands under dough center
3. Lift and let dough coil under itself
4. Rotate 90 degrees and repeat

### Letter Folds
For rectangular shaping:
1. Fold bottom third up
2. Fold top third down
3. Rotate 90 degrees
4. Repeat process

### Slap and Fold
For intensive gluten development:
1. Lift dough with both hands
2. Slap down on counter
3. Fold over itself
4. Repeat 10-20 times

## Shaping Fundamentals

### Pre-shaping

**Purpose:**
- Organizes gluten structure
- Creates surface tension
- Allows dough to relax before final shaping

**Technique:**
1. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface
2. Use bench scraper to fold edges toward center
3. Flip seam-side down
4. Drag on counter to create tension
5. Rest 20-30 minutes

### Final Shaping

#### Boule (Round Loaf)

1. **Start seam-side up**
2. **Fold bottom third up** and press to seal
3. **Fold left side in** and press
4. **Fold right side in** and press
5. **Roll from top down** creating tension
6. **Pinch seam closed**
7. **Place seam-side up** in banneton

#### Batard (Oval Loaf)

1. **Pat into rectangle**
2. **Fold bottom edge up** 1/3
3. **Fold sides in** slightly
4. **Fold top down** and seal
5. **Roll to create tension**
6. **Taper the ends**
7. **Place seam-side up** in oval banneton

### Shaping Tips

**For Success:**
- Work quickly but gently
- Use minimal flour
- Create even tension
- Seal seams properly
- Handle with confidence

**Avoid:**
- Over-flouring
- Tearing the dough
- Loose shaping
- Hesitation

## Troubleshooting Shaping Issues

### Dough Tears During Shaping
**Causes:**
- Over-fermented
- Insufficient gluten development
- Too much flour on surface

**Solutions:**
- Shorter bulk fermentation
- More folds during bulk
- Use less flour, wet hands instead

### Won't Hold Shape
**Causes:**
- Under-developed gluten
- Over-proofed
- Poor technique

**Solutions:**
- Better folding during bulk
- Shape earlier in process
- Practice building tension

### Seam Won't Stay Closed
**Solutions:**
- Use less flour on seam area
- Pinch more firmly
- Wet fingers slightly
- Place seam-side down immediately

## Building Intuition

### Visual Cues
- **Smooth surface:** Good gluten development
- **Even tension:** Proper shaping technique
- **Clean seam:** Well-sealed shape
- **Defined form:** Strong structure

### Tactile Cues
- **Supple feel:** Right hydration and development
- **Spring back:** Good gluten network
- **Smooth surface:** Proper technique
- **Holds shape:** Adequate tension

## Practice Exercises

### Folding Practice
1. Use lower hydration dough (65%)
2. Focus on technique over speed
3. Notice how dough changes with each fold
4. Practice with different timings

### Shaping Practice
1. Start with firm, well-developed dough
2. Shape the same piece multiple times
3. Focus on building tension
4. Practice both boule and batard shapes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much flour** during shaping
2. **Rushing** the process
3. **Insufficient tension** in final shape
4. **Tearing** the dough surface
5. **Inconsistent** technique

Remember: Good shaping comes from practice and understanding your dough. Each dough behaves differently based on hydration, flour type, and fermentation level. Build your skills gradually and pay attention to how the dough feels in your hands.
