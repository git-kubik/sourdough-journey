# ADR-004: GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-15

## Context
We needed a CI/CD solution that could:

- Automatically build and deploy documentation changes
- Integrate with our GitHub repository
- Build Docker images and push to private registry
- Deploy to Docker Swarm automatically
- Provide secure credential management
- Be cost-effective and easy to maintain

Alternative CI/CD options considered:

- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted complexity, maintenance overhead
- **GitLab CI**: Would require migrating from GitHub
- **Travis CI**: Additional service, costs for private repos
- **CircleCI**: External service, complex pricing
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft ecosystem, additional complexity

## Decision
We will use GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipeline.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch and pull requests
- **Workflow**: Build → Test → Push Image → Deploy to Swarm
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets for registry credentials
- **Self-Hosted Runner**: Custom runner for Swarm deployment access
- **Registry Authentication**: Secure login to private Docker registry
- **Deployment**: Service updates with `--with-registry-auth` flag

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration, no external services
- **Cost**: Free for public repos, reasonable pricing for private
- **Security**: GitHub Secrets for secure credential management
- **Flexibility**: Powerful workflow syntax with marketplace actions
- **Visibility**: Integrated with pull requests and repository
- **Community**: Large ecosystem of pre-built actions
- **Maintenance**: Managed service, no infrastructure to maintain

### Negative
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to GitHub platform
- **Runner Limitations**: GitHub-hosted runners have resource limits
- **Network Access**: Self-hosted runner needed for private infrastructure
- **Learning Curve**: YAML workflow syntax and GitHub Actions concepts

### Risks
- GitHub service outages affect deployments
- Self-hosted runner requires maintenance and security updates
- Secrets management depends on GitHub security
- Workflow complexity can grow with advanced requirements
- Network connectivity issues between runner and Swarm cluster
