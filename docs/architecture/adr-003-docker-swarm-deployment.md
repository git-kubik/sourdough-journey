# ADR-003: Docker Swarm for Deployment

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-15

## Context
We needed an orchestration platform for our containerized documentation that could:

- Provide high availability and automatic failover
- Enable zero-downtime deployments
- Manage load balancing and service discovery
- Integrate with our existing Docker infrastructure
- Be simple to operate and maintain

Alternative orchestration options considered:

- **Kubernetes**: More complex, overkill for our simple use case
- **Docker Compose**: No clustering or high availability
- **Nomad**: Additional tool to learn, smaller ecosystem
- **Manual deployment**: No orchestration, manual scaling and updates

## Decision
We will use Docker Swarm for container orchestration and deployment.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Service Name**: `sourdough-docs`
- **Deployment Strategy**: Rolling updates with service constraints
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in Swarm load balancing
- **Health Checks**: HTTP health checks on port 80
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling across Swarm nodes
- **Registry Integration**: Pull from private registry with authentication

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Simplicity**: Native Docker orchestration, familiar concepts
- **High Availability**: Automatic failover and service healing
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling updates without service interruption
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in load balancing across service replicas
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic DNS-based service discovery
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with Docker ecosystem
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower overhead compared to Kubernetes

### Negative
- **Limited Features**: Fewer advanced features than Kubernetes
- **Smaller Ecosystem**: Fewer third-party tools and integrations
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to Docker platform
- **Complex Networking**: Swarm networking can be complex to debug

### Risks
- Docker Swarm could be deprecated in favor of Kubernetes
- Limited advanced orchestration features for future growth
- Network troubleshooting complexity
- Single point of failure if registry is unavailable during deployments
