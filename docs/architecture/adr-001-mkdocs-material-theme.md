# ADR-001: MkDocs with Material Theme for Documentation

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-15

## Context
We needed a documentation platform that could:

- Generate static sites for easy deployment
- Provide good navigation and search capabilities
- Support markdown-based content creation
- Offer responsive design for various devices
- Enable easy customization and theming
- Support code syntax highlighting and mathematical expressions

Alternative options considered:

- GitBook: Commercial platform with limitations
- Sphinx: More complex setup, Python-focused
- Docusaurus: React-based, more complex for simple documentation
- Jekyll: Ruby-based, less documentation-focused
- VuePress: Vue.js-based, additional complexity

## Decision
We will use MkDocs with the Material theme for our documentation platform.

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity**: Markdown-based content with simple configuration
- **Rich Features**: Material theme provides excellent navigation, search, and responsive design
- **Python Ecosystem**: Aligns with potential Python tooling
- **Static Generation**: Easy to deploy anywhere, including Docker containers
- **Community**: Strong community support and extensive documentation
- **Customization**: Easy to customize appearance and functionality
- **Performance**: Fast site generation and loading

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development cycle for documentation updates
- Excellent user experience with responsive design and search
- Easy to deploy and host anywhere
- Good performance for end users
- Extensive customization options through Material theme
- Strong markdown support with extensions

### Negative
- Python dependency for build process
- Limited dynamic functionality (static site)
- Learning curve for advanced customization
- Tied to MkDocs ecosystem for plugins and extensions

### Risks
- MkDocs or Material theme could become unmaintained
- May need migration if requirements significantly change
- Build process requires Python environment
