# ADR-002: Docker Containerization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-15

## Context
We needed a deployment strategy that could:

- Ensure consistent environments across development and production
- Simplify deployment and scaling
- Isolate dependencies and runtime environment
- Enable easy rollbacks and updates
- Work with our chosen documentation platform (MkDocs)

Alternative deployment options considered:

- Direct server deployment: Manual setup, environment inconsistencies
- Virtual machines: Resource overhead, slower deployment
- Serverless (Netlify/Vercel): Vendor lock-in, limited control
- Static file hosting: Limited flexibility for future enhancements

## Decision
We will use Docker containerization with a multi-stage build approach.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Stage 1**: Python 3.11-slim for building MkDocs documentation
- **Stage 2**: nginx:alpine for serving static files
- **Base Images**: Official images for security and reliability
- **Optimization**: Multi-stage builds to minimize final image size

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistency**: Identical environments across all deployments
- **Portability**: Runs anywhere Docker is supported
- **Efficiency**: Small final image size (~15MB) due to multi-stage build
- **Security**: Minimal attack surface with nginx alpine image
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally
- **Version Control**: Image tags provide clear versioning
- **Rollbacks**: Easy to rollback to previous image versions

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional layer of abstraction
- **Docker Knowledge**: Team needs Docker expertise
- **Build Time**: Multi-stage builds take longer than simple deployments
- **Storage**: Requires Docker registry for image distribution

### Risks
- Docker security vulnerabilities in base images
- Registry availability affects deployments
- Potential performance overhead (minimal in practice)
- Dependency on Docker ecosystem
