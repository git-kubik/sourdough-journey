# Ingredient Sourcing: Local, Sustainable, Quality Ingredients

*Building a sustainable supply chain for exceptional sourdough*

Great sourdough starts with great ingredients. This guide helps you find the best flour, salt, and water while minimizing environmental impact and supporting local agriculture. Learn to balance quality, sustainability, and cost for your sourdough journey.

## üåæ Understanding Flour Quality

### What Makes Great Sourdough Flour

**Protein Content Fundamentals:**
- **Bread flour**: 12-14% protein (strong gluten network)
- **All-purpose**: 10-12% protein (versatile but weaker structure)
- **Whole wheat**: Variable protein, additional nutrients
- **Specialty grains**: Ancient wheats, rye, spelt considerations

**Milling Quality Indicators:**
- **Stone-milled**: Preserves nutrients, coarser texture
- **Roller-milled**: Consistent texture, longer shelf life
- **Fresh-milled**: Maximum nutrition, shorter storage life
- **Commercial**: Standardized, widely available

**Flour Freshness Factors:**
- **Milling date**: Ideally within 3-6 months
- **Storage conditions**: Cool, dry, pest-free
- **Packaging**: Paper breathes, plastic preserves
- **Color**: Cream (fresh) vs. white (aged/bleached)

### Quality Assessment Checklist

**Visual Inspection:**
- [ ] Natural cream color (not stark white)
- [ ] No visible insects or debris
- [ ] Consistent texture without lumps
- [ ] No off odors or musty smells

**Performance Indicators:**
- [ ] Good water absorption (feels thirsty)
- [ ] Strong gluten development when mixed
- [ ] Pleasant, wheaty aroma
- [ ] Consistent fermentation results

**Label Reading:**
- [ ] Protein percentage listed
- [ ] Unbleached and unbromated
- [ ] Minimal additives (ideally none)
- [ ] Clear milling or best-by dates
