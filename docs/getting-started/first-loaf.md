# Your First Sourdough Loaf: Complete One-Day Guide

Welcome to your first sourdough baking adventure! This guide will walk you through creating a beautiful 700g sourdough loaf in one day. Since you've maintained your starter for a month, you're ready for this exciting milestone.

## Ingredients List (700g Loaf)

### For the Dough:
- **400g** bread flour (12-13% protein content)
- **50g** whole wheat flour 
- **315g** water (room temperature, 70% hydration)
- **90g** active sourdough starter (20% of flour weight)
- **9g** salt (2% of flour weight)

### Additional Needs:
- Rice flour for dusting (prevents sticking)
- Water spray bottle for steam
- Banneton or bowl lined with tea towel

## Hour-by-Hour Schedule

### 8:00 PM (Previous Evening) - Feed Your Starter
- Mix 30g starter + 30g flour + 30g water
- Cover loosely and leave at room temperature (21-24°C/70-75°F)

### 7:00 AM - Starter Assessment
Your starter should have doubled or tripled in size and pass the float test:
- Drop a spoonful in water - it should float
- Smell should be pleasantly sour, not overly acidic
- Surface should show bubbles and have a domed appearance

### 8:00 AM - Autolyse
1. Mix 400g bread flour + 50g whole wheat flour + 315g water
2. Stir until no dry flour remains (no kneading needed)
3. Cover with damp towel
4. Let rest for 30-60 minutes

### 9:00 AM - Mix Dough
1. Add 90g active starter to the autolyse
2. Mix by hand using pinching motions until well incorporated (5-7 minutes)
3. Rest 30 minutes
4. Add 9g salt + 10g water
5. Mix again using pinch and fold method until smooth (5-7 minutes)

### 9:30 AM - Begin Bulk Fermentation
Temperature: 24-26°C (75-78°F)
Duration: 4-5 hours total

### 10:00 AM - First Fold
1. Wet your hand to prevent sticking
2. Grab dough from one side, stretch up and fold over
3. Rotate bowl 90 degrees, repeat 3 more times
4. Cover and rest 30 minutes

### 10:30 AM - Second Fold
Repeat folding process. Dough should feel stronger and more elastic.

### 11:00 AM - Third Fold
Dough should feel noticeably smoother and hold its shape better.

### 11:30 AM - Fourth Fold (Final)
After this fold, let dough rest undisturbed until ready.

### 2:00 PM - Check Bulk Fermentation
**Visual Cues for Readiness:**
- Dough increased by 50-70% in size
- Jiggly, alive appearance when bowl is shaken
- Smooth, domed surface
- Small bubbles visible through container sides
- Passes the poke test: gentle poke springs back slowly

### 2:30 PM - Pre-shape
1. Gently turn dough onto lightly floured surface
2. Use bench scraper to shape into loose round
3. Let rest 20-30 minutes uncovered

### 3:00 PM - Final Shaping
1. Shape into tight boule or batard
2. Place seam-side up in banneton dusted with rice flour
3. Cover with plastic bag or damp towel

### 3:30 PM - Cold Proof
Place in refrigerator for 12-48 hours (overnight is perfect)

### Next Day 7:00 AM - Prepare for Baking
1. Place Dutch oven in oven, preheat to 245°C (475°F) for 45 minutes
2. Cut parchment paper to fit

### 7:45 AM - Score and Bake
1. Turn dough onto parchment
2. Score with sharp blade (1/2 inch deep)
3. Transfer to hot Dutch oven
4. Bake covered: 20 minutes at 245°C (475°F)
5. Remove lid, reduce to 230°C (450°F)
6. Bake uncovered: 20-25 minutes until deep golden brown

### 8:30 AM - Cool
Let cool on wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.

## Step-by-Step Instructions with Visual Cues

### 1. Starter Readiness (7:00 AM)
**Visual cues:**
- Volume doubled or tripled
- Dome shape on top
- Network of bubbles throughout
- Pleasant, yogurt-like aroma

**Test:** Drop a teaspoon in water - it should float within 10 seconds.

### 2. Autolyse (8:00 AM)
**Technique:**
- Use a Danish dough whisk or sturdy spoon
- Mix until no dry flour visible
- Dough will look shaggy and rough - this is normal

**Visual cue:** All flour is hydrated, no dry pockets remain.

### 3. Mixing (9:00 AM)
**Technique:**
- Dimple starter into autolyse
- Use wet hands, pinch and fold repeatedly
- Work around the bowl systematically

**Visual cue:** Dough becomes smooth and cohesive, no streaks of starter visible.

### 4. Salt Addition
**Technique:**
- Sprinkle salt over surface
- Add small amount of water to help dissolve
- Pinch and squeeze dough to incorporate

**Visual cue:** Dough tightens and becomes more elastic.

### 5. Bulk Fermentation Folds
**Technique:**
- Wet hand, reach under dough
- Stretch up until resistance (don't tear)
- Fold over to opposite side
- Rotate bowl, repeat 4 times total

**Visual progression:**
- 1st fold: Dough feels loose, stretches easily
- 2nd fold: More resistance, holds shape better
- 3rd fold: Smooth, elastic, resists stretching
- 4th fold: Strong structure, maintains dome shape

### 6. Shaping
**Pre-shape technique:**
- Use bench scraper to release from bowl
- Fold edges toward center
- Flip seam-side down
- Drag on counter to create tension

**Final shape technique:**
- Flip dough seam-side up
- Fold bottom third up
- Fold sides in
- Roll from top, creating tension
- Pinch seam closed

### 7. Scoring
**Technique:**
- Use razor blade or lame
- Hold at 45-degree angle
- One confident, swift motion
- Depth: 1/4 to 1/2 inch

**Pattern suggestions for beginners:**
- Single slash down center
- Square pattern
- Simple cross

## Troubleshooting Common Beginner Issues

### Issue: Dough Too Sticky
**Causes:**
- Over-hydration
- Under-developed gluten
- Insufficient fermentation

**Solutions:**
- Use wet hands when handling
- Add 5-10g flour during mixing
- Ensure proper folding technique
- Check flour protein content (needs 12%+)

### Issue: Dense, Gummy Crumb
**Causes:**
- Under-fermented
- Under-baked
- Cut too soon

**Solutions:**
- Extend bulk fermentation
- Check internal temp (96-99°C/205-210°F)
- Cool completely before cutting

### Issue: Flat Loaf, No Oven Spring
**Causes:**
- Over-proofed
- Weak starter
- Poor shaping

**Solutions:**
- Reduce bulk fermentation time
- Ensure starter doubles in 4-6 hours
- Practice shaping technique
- Score deeper

### Issue: Irregular Crumb
**Causes:**
- Uneven folding
- Poor shaping
- Inconsistent temperature

**Solutions:**
- Fold evenly during bulk
- Shape with consistent tension
- Maintain steady temperature

### Issue: Burnt Bottom
**Causes:**
- Oven too hot
- Rack position too low

**Solutions:**
- Place rack in middle position
- Add parchment under loaf
- Reduce temperature after removing lid

## Assessing Dough Development

### During Bulk Fermentation:
1. **30% increase:** Dough feels stronger, holds folds
2. **50% increase:** Jiggly movement, visible bubbles
3. **70% increase:** Ready to shape, domed surface

### The Poke Test:
- **Springs back quickly:** Under-proofed
- **Springs back slowly with slight indent:** Perfect
- **No spring back:** Over-proofed

### Window Pane Test:
Stretch small piece of dough:
- **Tears immediately:** Needs more development
- **Stretches thin without tearing:** Ready

## Final Tips for Success

1. **Temperature matters:** Use a thermometer to track dough temp (aim for 24-26°C/75-78°F)
2. **Be patient:** Good fermentation can't be rushed
3. **Take notes:** Record times and temperatures for future reference
4. **Trust the process:** Each step builds on the previous
5. **Practice:** Your hands will learn the feel of properly developed dough

Remember, your first loaf might not be perfect, and that's okay! Each bake teaches you something new about the process. Focus on learning the visual and tactile cues rather than strict timing.

Happy baking! Your kitchen is about to smell amazing.
