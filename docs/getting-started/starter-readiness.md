# Assessing Starter Readiness

A healthy, active starter is the foundation of great sourdough bread. After maintaining your starter for a month, you should be familiar with its behavior, but here's a comprehensive guide to ensure it's ready for baking.

## The Five Signs of a Ready Starter

### 1. Predictable Doubling Time
**What to look for:**
- Doubles in volume within 4-8 hours at room temperature (70-75°F/21-24°C)
- Consistent timing day after day
- Peak activity occurs at roughly the same time after feeding

**How to test:**
- Mark the starter level with a rubber band after feeding
- Check hourly to observe rise pattern
- Note the time to reach peak (double or triple in size)

### 2. The Float Test
**What it tells you:** Your starter has enough gas production to leaven bread.

**How to perform:**
1. Fill a bowl with room temperature water
2. Gently drop a spoonful of starter into the water
3. Don't stir - let it settle naturally

**Results:**
- **Floats:** Ready to use
- **Sinks slowly:** Almost ready, wait 30 minutes
- **Sinks quickly:** Needs more time or feeding

### 3. Appearance and Texture
**Active starter characteristics:**
- **Surface:** Domed or slightly rounded, not collapsed
- **Bubbles:** Network of bubbles throughout, various sizes
- **Texture:** Fluffy, airy, increased volume
- **Consistency:** Thick but pourable, like thick pancake batter

**Warning signs:**
- Liquid layer on top (hooch) - needs feeding
- Flat or sunken surface - past peak
- Few or no bubbles - not active enough
- Very runny consistency - over-fermented

### 4. Aroma Profile
**Healthy starter smells:**
- Pleasantly sour, like yogurt
- Slightly sweet undertones
- Fresh, yeasty aroma
- Hints of apple or vinegar (mild)

**Problematic smells:**
- Strong acetone or nail polish - very hungry
- Overly acidic or sharp - needs more frequent feeding
- Musty or moldy - discard and start fresh
- No smell at all - not active

### 5. The Seed Test
**Advanced readiness check:**
1. Take 10g of starter
2. Mix with 50g flour and 50g water
3. Mark the level
4. Should double in 4-6 hours

This tests your starter's vigor and predictability.

## Temperature and Timing Guide

### Optimal Temperatures:
- **Feeding:** 70-75°F (21-24°C)
- **Peak activity:** 75-80°F (24-27°C)
- **Storage:** 38-40°F (3-4°C) for refrigerator

### Timing by Temperature:
- **65°F (18°C):** Peak in 8-12 hours
- **70°F (21°C):** Peak in 6-8 hours
- **75°F (24°C):** Peak in 4-6 hours
- **80°F (27°C):** Peak in 3-4 hours

## Feeding Ratios and Their Effects

### Standard Feeding (1:1:1)
- 50g starter : 50g flour : 50g water
- Maintains moderate activity
- Good for daily baking

### Vigorous Feeding (1:5:5)
- 10g starter : 50g flour : 50g water
- Builds strong activity
- Use before important bakes

### Maintenance Feeding (1:2:2)
- 25g starter : 50g flour : 50g water
- Balanced approach
- Good for consistent results

## Troubleshooting Starter Issues

### Starter Won't Float
**Possible causes:**
- Not at peak activity
- Needs stronger flour (use bread flour)
- Hydration too high
- Temperature too low

**Solutions:**
- Wait for true peak (not just doubled)
- Switch to bread flour for feeding
- Reduce water slightly (try 45g instead of 50g)
- Move to warmer location

### Inconsistent Rising
**Possible causes:**
- Temperature fluctuations
- Irregular feeding schedule
- Weak flour
- Chlorinated water

**Solutions:**
- Find consistent temperature spot
- Set timer for regular feedings
- Use unbleached bread flour
- Use filtered water

### Too Acidic
**Signs:**
- Very sour smell
- Rises and falls quickly
- Hooch forms frequently

**Solutions:**
- Feed more frequently (2x daily)
- Use higher feeding ratio (1:5:5)
- Keep slightly cooler
- Discard more before feeding

## Pre-Bake Preparation

### 12 Hours Before Baking:
1. Give vigorous feeding (1:5:5 ratio)
2. Maintain at 75°F if possible
3. Plan for peak activity timing

### Testing Peak Activity:
1. **Visual:** Maximum height reached
2. **Texture:** Jiggly when jar is tapped
3. **Surface:** Just beginning to flatten
4. **Float test:** Passes easily

### Using Your Starter:
- Use within 1-2 hours of peak
- Have dough ready for starter addition
- Reserve some for next feeding
- Never use all your starter

## Maintaining Long-Term Health

### Weekly Maintenance:
- Discard and feed at least 2x weekly
- Clean jar monthly
- Observe and note changes
- Adjust ratios as needed

### Monthly Check-up:
- Test doubling time
- Assess aroma changes
- Check for consistency
- Perform seed test

### Seasonal Adjustments:
- **Summer:** May need more frequent feeding
- **Winter:** May need warmer location
- **Humidity:** Affects hydration needs
- **Flour changes:** New batch may behave differently

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before using your starter for baking, confirm:

- [ ] Doubles in 4-8 hours consistently
- [ ] Passes float test
- [ ] Pleasant, yogurt-like aroma
- [ ] Bubble network throughout
- [ ] Domed or slightly flat top (not sunken)
- [ ] Fed within last 12 hours
- [ ] At or just before peak activity
- [ ] Correct temperature (70-80°F)

## Emergency Fixes

### Starter Rescue (if neglected):
1. Pour off hooch
2. Discard all but 10g
3. Feed 1:10:10 ratio
4. Feed 2x daily for 3 days
5. Should recover full activity

### Quick Activation:
1. Feed 1:5:5 with warm water (85°F)
2. Place in warm spot (80°F)
3. Should peak in 3-4 hours
4. Use immediately at peak

Remember: A healthy starter is the foundation of great sourdough. Take time to understand your starter's unique behavior - it's a living culture with its own personality!
